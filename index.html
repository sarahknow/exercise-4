        LET us go then, you and I,<br>  
        When the evening is spread out against the sky<br>  
        Like a patient etherized upon a table;  <br>
        Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, <br>  
        The muttering retreats          5<br>
        Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels<br>    
        And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: <br>
        Streets that follow like a tedious argument <br>
        Of insidious intent <br>
        To lead you to an overwhelming question…. <br>          10
        Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”<br>   
        Let us go and make our visit.<br>   
         
        In the room the women come and go  <br> 
        Talking of Michelangelo. <br>   
         
        The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,<br>            15
        The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes  <br> 
        Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, <br> 
        Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,<br>   
        Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, <br>  
        Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, <br>        20
        And seeing that it was a soft October night,<br>    
        Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.<br>   
         
        And indeed there will be time   <br>
        For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,<br>  
        Rubbing its back upon the window panes;<br>        
        There will be time, there will be time <br> 
        To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;<br>  
        There will be time to murder and create, <br>   
        And time for all the works and days of hands <br>   
        That lift and drop a question on your plate; <br>           30
        Time for you and time for me,   <br>
        And time yet for a hundred indecisions, <br>
        And for a hundred visions and revisions, <br>   
        Before the taking of a toast and tea. <br>  
         
        In the room the women come and go  <br>         35
        Talking of Michelangelo.  <br>

    <p>And indeed there will be time <br>  
    To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?” <br>  
    Time to turn back and descend the stair, <br>   
    With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—   <br>       40
    (They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)    <br>
    My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, <br>
    My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin— <br>  
    (They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”) <br> 
    Do I dare           45<br>
    Disturb the universe? <br>  
    In a minute there is time <br>  
    For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. <br>   
     
    For I have known them all already, known them all:  <br>
    Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,  <br>        50
    I have measured out my life with coffee spoons; <br>
    I know the voices dying with a dying fall  <br> 
    Beneath the music from a farther room.  <br>
      So how should I presume?  <br>
     
    And I have known the eyes already, known them all— <br>         55
    The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, <br>  
    And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, <br>  
    When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,<br> 
    Then how should I begin <br>
    To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?  <br>        60
      And how should I presume? <br>
     
    And I have known the arms already, known them all—  <br>
    Arms that are braceleted and white and bare <br>
    (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)  <br> 
    Is it perfume from a dress    <br>      65
    That makes me so digress?<br>   
    Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. <br>
      And should I then presume?    <br>
      And how should I begin?<br>
    .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .<br>
    Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets   <br>      70
    And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes <br>
    Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?… <br>   
     
    I should have been a pair of ragged claws  <br> 
    Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.<br>
    .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .<br>
    </p>

    <h1 class="sec03">Part 3</h1>
    <p>And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! <br>          75
    Smoothed by long fingers, <br>  
    Asleep … tired … or it malingers,  <br> 
    Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me. <br>
    Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, <br>
    Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? <br>           80
    But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, <br>
    Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter, <br>
    I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter; <br>
    I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,<br> 
    And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,<br>          85
    And in short, I was afraid. <br>
     
    And would it have been worth it, after all, <br>
    After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, <br>
    Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, <br>
    Would it have been worth while, <br>        90
    To have bitten off the matter with a smile, <br>
    To have squeezed the universe into a ball  <br> 
    To roll it toward some overwhelming question,   <br>
    To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,<br>  
    Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”— <br>          95
    If one, settling a pillow by her head, <br> 
      Should say: “That is not what I meant at all; <br>
      That is not it, at all.”  <br>
     
    And would it have been worth it, after all, <br>
    Would it have been worth while,         100<br>
    After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, <br> 
    After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—   <br>
    And this, and so much more?—    <br>
    It is impossible to say just what I mean!   <br>
    But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: <br>        105
    Would it have been worth while  v
    If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, <br> 
    And turning toward the window, should say: <br> 
      “That is not it at all,   <br>
      That is not what I meant, at all.”<br>
    </p>
        <h1 class="sec04">Part 4</h1>
        <p>.      .      .      .      .      .      .      .<br>
        110
No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;  <br>  
Am an attendant lord, one that will do  <br>
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,  <br>
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool, <br> 
Deferential, glad to be of use,         115<br>
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;  <br>
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;  <br>  
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—   <br> 
Almost, at times, the Fool. <br>
 
I grow old … I grow old …           120<br>
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. <br>
 
Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?  <br>
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. <br>  
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.    <br>
 
I do not think that they will sing to me.           125<br>
 
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves    <br>
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back <br> 
When the wind blows the water white and black.  <br>
 
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea <br>
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown  <br>          130
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.</p>
